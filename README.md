### Project Background

<p>This project was designed with Texas data on school locations and Texas State Park trails. To reduce the scope of the project, it was limited to Mineral Wells. The choice to limit to Mineral Wells was mostly because my family used to visit Mineral Wells State Park multiple times a year to go hiking and camping.

### Purpose

<p>The purpose of this project was to map the locations of all schools and hiking trails in and surrounding Mineral Wells to find the distances between schools and hiking trails.
